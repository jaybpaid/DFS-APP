## Agent System Architecture

### MasterBuilderApp Delegation Strategy

The MasterBuilderApp intelligently routes tasks to specialized agents based on:

1. **Context Analysis**: Examines request content, file types, and project structure
2. **Complexity Assessment**: Determines required expertise level
3. **Agent Selection**: Routes to optimal specialist or team
4. **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinates multi-step tasks
5. **Result Integration**: Merges outputs into cohesive solutions

### DFS-Specific Workflow Examples

#### Slate Optimization

```
"Optimize DFS slate analysis algorithm"
â†’ dfs-analysis-team (dfs-optimizer + data-scientist + ai-engineer + business-analyst)
```

#### Player Data Pipeline

```
"Build real-time player data pipeline"
â†’ dfs-data-team (dfs-data-engineer + data-scientist + database-optimizer + data-engineer)
```

#### Security Hardening

```
"Implement security hardening for production"
â†’ dfs-security-team (dfs-security-specialist + security-auditor + backend-security-coder + frontend-security-coder)
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics Tracked

- Task completion rate
- Average response time
- Delegation accuracy
- User satisfaction score
- Error rate
- Resource utilization

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Task completion < 80%, Response time > 3600s, Error rate > 10%
- **Warning**: Task completion < 90%, Response time > 1800s, Error rate > 5%
- **Info**: Task completion < 95%, Response time > 900s

## Usage Instructions

### For DFS Development Tasks

1. **Slate Optimization**: Ask the MasterBuilderApp to optimize DFS algorithms
2. **Data Pipelines**: Request real-time player data pipeline development
3. **Frontend Enhancements**: Ask for dashboard improvements and new visualizations
4. **Security Hardening**: Request security audits and compliance checks
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ask for scalability and performance improvements

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run full automation pipeline
pnpm run claude:automate

# Format and lint code
pnpm run claude:quality

# Build all services
pnpm run claude:build

# Run all tests
pnpm run claude:test

# Deploy to production
pnpm run claude:deploy

# Check service health
pnpm run claude:health
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

The system is configured to trigger GitHub Actions on:

- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Available Workflows

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Claude Automation**: Code quality and formatting
- **DFS Integration**: Specialized DFS testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: System health checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Agent Not Activating**
   - Ensure request clearly indicates domain and complexity level
   - Provide sufficient context about tech stack and requirements

2. **Suboptimal Delegation**
   - Include background information and project constraints
   - Specify quality standards and technical requirements

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check model availability and switch to alternative providers
   - Verify API keys and network connectivity

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Debug agent selection
claude debug agents --request "optimize DFS algorithm"

# Test agent delegation
claude test delegation --from masterbuilderapp --to dfs-optimizer

# Validate configuration
claude validate config --agents --openrouter
```
